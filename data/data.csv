other voluntary organisations to set up a food partnership in the borough.
The aims of this partnership are to ensure access to affordable, health,
and sustainable food. The sustainability element will focus on local and
low-carbon foods (such as meat free diets). Additionally, the council is
developing a resident’s action pack, which gives advice to residence for
how they can reduce their carbon footprint. Dietary changes, including
reducing meat and dairy consumption, are one of the many areas covered in
this guidance. The council also has Low Carbon Procurement Policy and
Toolkit to explain when and where considerations for addressing and
reducing carbon emissions should be considered during the procurement
process (this can be used when sourcing catering for events, for example).
Through the Councils Leisure Management Contractor Places Leisure, the
leisure centres operator has made available a selection of Plant based
products, which are offered within selected Cafeology branded coffee shops
within leisure centres, and their current sandwich supplier used across

provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure

Vegan meals / options were included as a requirement for Nursery Meals.
Vegan meals / options were also included as a requirement at the Brighton
Centre.
Within Adult Social Care, providing vegan meals is not a requirement within the
Care Homes contract. Individual dietary needs and preferences would be a part
of any assessment and Care & Support planning. As such this would need to be
specifically taken into consideration by the prospective provider service when
receiving a referral and whether they can meet these particular needs.
Additionally, the answer is yes for our in-house provider services (care homes).
Each provider caters for dietary needs on an individual basis, which includes
vegan meals. This is based on an assessment of the service user's needs on
admission and discussions with the service user.

diet requirements from religion to diabetic meals which is just two of many we
provide.

When we assess people for a room at Craven Vale we discuss dietary
requirements. If a person was vegan, then we would inform the kitchen so that
their requirements can be catered for. This is done on an individual basis.
Wayfield Avenue
Offer a meat free option at each mealtime daily. This is 50% of the meals we
offer although they are not always vegan-they are often vegetarian.
Our kitchen team meet all service users who state that they have a specific
dietary requirement to include veganism. They will go through with the person
what they like or dislike and discuss how they can provide meals which support
the persons requirements.
The kitchen team advises that they offer a range of different vegan meals and
produce these meals by using egg substitutes, vegan cream, milk and cheese
to ensure that the diet is varied and balanced.

The Nutritional Requirements for Food and Drink in Schools (Scotland)
Regulations and the Better Eating Better Learning (BEBL) guidance set by
Scottish Government require school catering services to provide for pupils
with special dietary requirements as a result of a health care need. 

School catering is an inhouse service and all produce is procured via
Scotland Excel frameworks.

No menu requirements are outlined in the Art Gallery & Museums concession
agreement (2019), which was signed before the recognition of ethical
veganism as a protected characteristic.

4.       Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy
consumption in order to meet environmental goals? 

a.       If yes, please detail what actions have been taken, e.g. 100% or
50% plant-based food options offered.

Many young people choose to make changes to their food intake in response
to their own beliefs and opinions. We as a Council cannot guarantee to
provide for all personal preferences, however through a varied menu,
choice will always be available.  All of our School Lunch menus have a
vegetarian choice daily.  The current Primary School menu has 27 out of 45
dishes vegetarian, which is 60 %, an increase of 6% on our previous menu,
this includes three days which are meat free days over the 3-week menu
cycle.  From the 27 dishes that are vegetarian 44% of these dishes are
suitable for vegans.  Vegan products such as mayonnaise and cheese have
been introduced into the kitchens store cupboards to allow them to easily
adapt recipes.   

Aberdeen City Council are also looking at changing from using vegetarian
products e.g. Quorn products, to their vegan alternatives for the main
menu.   We have extended the meat free days to once per week, and we have
developed a vegan menu, which will offer vegan alternatives each day
further complimenting the main menu. 

We ensure that all products procured are within the legal requirements of
the UK veterinary regulations. We also ensure that menus meet the healthy
choice and nutrition requirements set within curriculum for excellence
which is taught in schools. The Council strives to give a balanced choice
as per Aberdeen City Council and Scottish Government policies and
regulations.  In addition to this we also currently hold the Bronze award
for the Soil Associations Food for Life accreditation which covers
environmental issues by ensuring that the menus we provide meet a strict
criteria –

•                                  At least 75% of dishes on the menu are
freshly prepared

•                                  All meat is from farms which satisfy UK
animal welfare standards

•                                  No fish are served from the Marine
Conservation Society ‘fish to avoid’ list

•                                  Eggs are from free range hens

•                                  No undesirable additives or artificial
trans fats

•                                  No genetically modified (GM)
ingredients.

The Food and Drinks within Schools regulations which was implemented in
April 2021, required a reduction the volume of red and red processed meat
dishes across Scotland in all School meal settings, therefore reducing the
frequency in which these dishes can be served.  This has been fully
implemented and resulted in red or red processed meat dishes being on
offer a maximum of 3 times per week, which has resulted in a significant
reduction in what we may have provided previously.  All of our red meat is
purchased and produced by our local butcher, there are a limited number of
items on our menus which are processed, but such products still meet the
Food for Life Standards as listed above.

As you can appreciate our catering service strives to provide a healthy
nutritious menu for our children on a citywide basis where we try to
accommodate as many children as possible daily.  The service also does
endeavour to provide a wide and varied meal choice daily city wide within
a set budget for all our clients and we need to be realistic in the
decisions we make.  I am sure you can appreciate the difficulties that are
presented with such a wide audience and varying opinions.

Going forward we are always open for further suggestions in how we can try
and best accommodate everyone’s tastes taking account of the regulations
and where we can safely provide meal dishes within our operational
establishments.

Bradford City Council,Amber,"With regard to the Public Sector Equality Duty, does your decision-making

Response: The school meal catering service ensures equality of provision to
include options such as meat, halal meat, vegetarian, vegan, medical diets,
allergen adjusted diets.
How many vegan hot and cold meal options do you offer:
Response: Every individual school menu is bespoke to the school, vegan options
are available, the menu mix for each school varies with the individual school
requirements and demographics.
In your own local authority canteen every day (if you have one)? 0, 1, 2, 3 or more.

In external events catering (if applicable)? Eg: 0, 1, 2, 3 or more.

Response: All external event catering and hospitality catering is bespoke and

Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included within the
catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering provision for which you
are responsible including schools, leisure centres, care homes, libraries, and any
other public buildings?  Yes/No
Response: The above question is a misunderstanding about who is responsible for
issuing and/or the decision maker for catering procurement contracts:
• The food offer is bespoke for all premises in schools and care homes, menu’s
includes vegan options. There is no catering provision in leisure centres or libraries.
• Individual schools and Academy Trust write and issue their own bespoke catering
procurement contracts not the Council or Local Authority. The Council’s catering
service bids in competition with the private sector for the individual school and
Academy catering contracts. (Also be aware that many schools and Academy
Trusts use third party contract letting agents to write and oversee their letting of
catering tenders)
• In summary, Local Authority catering service providers have to conform to the
individual school’s or Academy Trust’s contractual requirements.
• Many Academy Trusts are not based on Local Authority areas and can include
schools from a number of different Council or Local Authority areas.
Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy consumption in order to meet environmental goals?
Response: The service adheres to the Government’s School Food Guidelines which
includes a requirement to serve meat and dairy choices a minimum number of times, all school and Academy Trust catering contracts are based on the requirement to adhere to the Government’s School Food Guidelines and School Governors have anobligation to ensure that their school is compliant to the School Food Guidelines.. The service is obliged to do so, beyond this the service has a “meat free Monday” though some individual schools and Academy Trusts choose to opt out and don’t want the option as part of their catering contract.
Â·        If yes, please detail what actions have been taken, e.g. 100% or 50% plantbased food options offered.
Response: The mix will be bespoke to each individual school menu, we check that
each bespoke school menu complies with the School Food Guidelines.
Â·        If no, do you have ambitions to take action in this area, eg through setting meat reduction targets? Yes/no, if yes please detail what ambitions you have set out.
Response: The service targets compliance to the School Food Guidelines, compliance to Food For Life and to meet the bespoke contractual requirements of each individual school or Academy Trust catering contract.
Overall there is a misunderstanding of Local Authority influence over schools, this used to be the case decades ago when all schools were Maintained and part of the Local Authority. Now most schools are Academy’s or in Academy Trusts and are separate legal entities from Local Authorities. That not withstanding all schools have to market test their catering service and schools have a requirement to meet the Government’s School Food Guidelines. Local Authorities have no ability to dictate Food Policy to schools or Academy Trusts which are separate legal entities."

part of our supply chain, we request vegan products to be made available
under the NEPO contracts, for example we include plant based products in
the procurement process and have these available on the school meals
menus.

Question 4
Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy
consumption in order to meet environmental goals? 

Answer 4
Yes, in school meals we have meat free Mondays every week so 20% of the
days are meat free. On every other day we offer both meat based products
and vegetarian options. The current menu has a vegan option on every day
in our 3 week menu.

Question 4a
If yes, please detail what actions have been taken, e.g., 100% or 50%
plant-based food options offered.

Answer 4a
As we have a vegan option on every day in the school meals menu, we
therefore have 100% availability. In terms of the vegan choice across
every main meal that equates to 44%. We review our menus on an annual
basis, and we are working with ProVeg to assess the vegetarian and vegan
options we have on offer.

Question 4b
If no, do you have ambitions to take action in this area, e.g., through
setting meat reduction targets? Yes/no, if yes please detail what
ambitions you have set out.

In July 2019, the Council passed a motion declaring a climate emergency and committed to working towards ensuring that the Council and the borough of Rochdale is carbon neutral by 2038. The Council recognised the need to take a leadership role and work in partnership to achieve this target. A climate change strategy and action plan for the borough has been developed which sets out a broad approach for addressing the climate emergency. The strategy includes a range of targets that we need to work towards if we are to succeed in becoming a carbon neutral borough by 2038 – reducing consumption of the most carbon intensive foods is one of them. The action plan includes a number of actions in support of the strategy, one being to promote healthier eating, in particular encouraging a shift away from meat based to plant based diets. 

You can view the strategy and action plan on our website using this link: Climate Change Strategies | Rochdale Borough Council

The Council takes an active role in educating and raising awareness through communication campaigns, information sharing, training and events. Food is a theme that is promoted. All of this activity is designed to influence behaviour change. 

Our website includes dedicated pages which can be viewed here: Climate change and sustainability – Rochdale Borough Council

We are rolling out a programme of Carbon Literacy to our staff, which included provision of a plant based lunch.

We have developed curriculum materials which are being used in local schools to educate young people about this issue.

Q. How many vegan hot and cold meal options do you offer:

In your own local authority canteen every day (if you have one)? 0, 1, 2,
3 or more. Please also express this as a proportion of the overall number
of options offered. 

 A. In our main Council Offices No hot or cold meals are provided. Snacks
and sandwiches are available via a vending machine which does provide
vegan options. At our Green Space facilities we offer items which include
a Vegan breakfast, Vegan Burger (both Children’s and Adult Options) and a
selection of Vegan Cakes

Q. In external events catering (if applicable)? Eg: 0, 1, 2, 3 or more.

Please also express this as a proportion of the overall number of options
offered.  

A. We have vegetarian and vegan options at all our internally organised
events and actively target concessions offering vegan and vegetarian
cuisine as this meets the needs of a large proportion of Sandwell’s
demographic.

Q. Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included
within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering
provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure
centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings?  Yes/No

 A. Yes and in regards to our vending solution to our main council
offices.

Q. Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy
consumption in order to meet environmental goals?

 A. The Council has not taken specific action to reduce meat and dairy
consumption within the organisation itself, however through our Public
Health team we advocate for residents to adopt a more plant based diet for
both health and environmental benefits via websites and social media.

Public Health are currently working with SIPS (a large local non-profit
school services provider) and ProVeg to review and reduce the climate
impact of the meals served at the roughly 60% of primary schools in
Sandwell who use SIPS food service. A review we completed late last year
identified this as the best single opportunity to influence the climate
impact and nutritional quality of food served in the borough – we believe
SIPS school food service to be the largest institutional catering service
in the locality. We secured an agreement from SIPS to work with ProVeg in
March.

School Food Standards stipulate that some dairy is served every day and
some meat is served at least three times a week, so based on 10 meal
options per week and depending on how the dairy element is offered (e.g.
could be cheese incorporated in a hot meal, but could also be milk as a
drink) the ambition is for between 50% and 70% of meals to be fully
plant-based. Working with primary schools also helps to normalise
plant-based food for families and young people living in the borough.

We are currently exploring how to expand this across the remaining schools
and implement an equivalent model in other local partner organisations

The Council is committed to understanding the impacts of all our decisions on
the residents of Stockport through Equality Impact Assessments. Equality Impact
Assessments include consideration of potential impact on the nine protected
characteristics in the Equality Act, which includes Religion or Belief. We
understand that veganism is a belief system covered by Religion or Belief and we
therefore consider impacts on people who are vegan where relevant. In all
external-facing food strategies and plans, cultural and ethical beliefs are
taken into account, including through an extensive process of engagement with
communities across Stockport to better understand the diversity of need and the
current challenges faced across the Food System.

Stockport Council irregularly provides food at meetings and events. Through our
Climate Action Now work, which centres around our climate change strategy, we
have worked with our events team to increase the variety of vegetarian and vegan
options available. Similarly, through hosting our Climate Action Now summit,
Climate Action Business Forum and staff training at external venues we have, as
a council, influenced other companies to increase their vegetarian and vegan
offer. For example, Stockport Council hosted our Climate Action Now summit 2022
at Cornerstone and requested a fully vegan/vegetarian menu for the event. The
provider worked to create a vegan offer and have gone on to add these options to
their regular menu. 

Further to this, Stockport Council set up and run an annual project with
young people, called the Stockport Schools Climate Assembly. Through this
project, schools receive a Climate Action lesson pack which includes information
about carbon footprints, including the impact of food choices. At the end of
the lesson, young people come up with actions that they will do, that they
would like their school to do and that they would like the council to do. The
young people go on to debate the actions they have proposed for the council, and
they vote on which idea to support.

In March this year young people from across the borough proposed and voted to
support ""community gardens where people can plant and pick fruit and veg,
reducing the carbon footprint of food."" Stockport Council is committed to acting
on what the young people vote for and are currently developing a response to
this action which will include food & climate lesson packs for schools and the
creation of new food growing spaces.

Additionally, Stockport Council is currently updating Stockport's food strategy
which will be published in the coming months. Environment is one of the key
pillars of the new food plan - encompassing spaces for food growing, community
gardens, support for businesses and education around health and low carbon
diets."

 Yes

 

How many vegan hot and cold meal options do you offer: 

 

In your own local authority canteen every day (if you have one)? 0, 1, 2,
3 or more. Please also express this as a proportion of the overall number
of options offered.   Our Catering concession contractor regularly offers
3+ vegan options in the Staff Break-out area of Merton Civic Centre.

Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included
within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering
provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure
centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings?  

 

Yes – we do require a vegan meal offer within our primary & special
schools.  While we don’t have a specific contractual target, we do require
the caterer to offer either a vegan option as one of the two main dishes
on the daily menu in primary schools or as one of 3 alternative dishes for
schools to select in place of the standard offer.  The choice is for
schools individually but, in addition, there is a requirement to provide a
vegan meal if required in place of the main offerings should those be a
vegetarian and a meat or fish based dish. We also asked the caterer to
increase the vegetable ingredients of dishes that are meat based and have
moved to 2 meat free days as part of our standard offer (although schools
can opt out of that if they wish).

 

There are contracts in place across libraries to provide a broad range of
catering to meet the majority of dietary considerations. Within these
contracts there are no targets regarding reducing meat and dairy
consumption but we do continue to promote healthy options.

 

It is not a requirement within the Corporate Catering concessionary
contract within Merton Civic centre, however there is a requirement to
provide vegetarian option/s.

 

For Leisure centres - At Morden where we do sell limited cold meal
options, we do offer a vegan option.

 

The council does not hold information on care homes, to obtain this
information please contact the care home(s) direct.

consumption in order to meet environmental goals? 

 

If yes, please detail what actions have been taken, e.g. 100% or 50%
plant-based food options offered.  Our catering concession contractor
provides a number of vegetarian and vegan options which have replaced meat
based meals, so in effect has acted by offering less meat based options.

Yes, Primary schools.

 

‘Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy
consumption in order to meet environmental goals.’

Yes as follow.

•       Beans and lentils are really good sources of protein and fibre but
are also lower in saturated fat. 

• The Council has reduced the saturated fat by an average of 8% per a
portion.

          -         The Council has increased the fibre by an average of
60% per a portion helping more children meet their daily fibre
requirements.

          -         The Council is contributing more towards children’s 5
a day as the added lentils & beans provide essential vitamins and
minerals.

 

•        The Council is reducing our CO2 emissions by an average of 420g
per meal where these recipes are being used. That is the equivalent of
driving a medium sized

  petrol car for almost a mile.

•        Continuing to add more plant based options.

•        New project undertaken by Exec Chefs and Nutrition team to make
recipes healthier and more sustainable.

Response:
Waltham Forest Council is committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions
by 2030. To achieve this bold target, we need to translate ambition into
action across all areas - what we grow, what we eat and how we use our
land are a vital part of this.
The Council already has several initiatives associated with this agenda.
Our
Climate Action Plan and Biodiversity action plan include commitments to
reducing food waste and creating a greener, more resilient borough. We are
also developing a new food strategy.
Finally, last year, Waltham Forest won an award for our school dinners
topping the 'UK Greenest School Menu League Table'; as we currently serve
up one million plant-based school meals a year, to the 50 primary and
secondary schools who currently subscribe to our catering service. I'm
sure you will agree our school meals are a big part of this agenda and one
that we can affect positive change not just in the short term, but the
medium and long term as well, as we are influencing current pupils- who
will become our future adults- eating and food shopping habits and
behaviours.
In support of this, we are backing calls to remove the need for mandatory
servings of meat, fish, and dairy as part of the Government review of the
School Food Standards, and are committed to the following actions:
• 20% increase in plant-based menu options in schools and the
corresponding decrease in meat consumption in schools
• increase in take up of school meals by pupils in Waltham Forest schools
• work with Waltham Forest College to ensure that our caterers of the
future have the climate emergency and sustainability as part of their
course and professional development, and
• work with early adopters to introduce more ‘meat free days’ and develop
case studies to showcase."

order to assist with a response:
• Facilities and Building Services
• Heritage Services
• Climate and Environmental Sustainability
• Children’s Social Care
• Adults Social Care
Response from Facilities and Building Services:
The Council does not have an in-house provision of catering for the office spaces. There is a small catering concession in one of the office buildings, which offers a variety of choices including vegan options. There is no specific ratio for the number of options available and the menu will vary from week to week. The selections and quantities produced are demand led.
For Guildhall events, the event organisers select their own caterers for functions, as appropriate to the specific event needs.
Response from Heritage Services:
In regard to external events catering:
Guildhall – We don’t have any restrictions over which caterers clients use for their events at the Guildhall, Victoria Art Gallery or in the Parks as long as they have insurance. As a service we are however developing a listed caterer scheme for these venues. Clients will not be obliged to use one of our listed caterers, but we will be ensuring that this list includes a range of caterers and that all will be able to cater for vegans along with other dietary preferences.Roman Baths & Pump Room - Searcy’s are currently contracted to deliver our event catering in the Roman Baths & Pump Room – Their event menus cater for a full selection of dietary options and are put together based on the request of the client. They cannot provide a % of options as each menu is designed to be individually modified to suit the request. They have delivered several events with entire vegan menus over the term of the current contract.
In regards to your question:
“Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings?...”
Roman Baths & Pump Room – In the Pump Room restaurant Searcy’s offer vegan options for all their menus. Customers highlight their preference when booking online. The menus are then made bespoke for each customer booking. This is highlighted on their website and onsite.
Response from Climate and Environmental Sustainability:
We have an action in the Ecological Emergency Action Plan (published here:https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/document-and-policy-library/ecological-emergencyaction-plan) to ‘Review and update the Council’s approach to food to integrate opportunities to reduce the impact of food production on nature’, through which we will be looking at opportunities to reduce the impact of food procurement etc. on the natural environment (as and when the Council’s Food Strategy is reviewed).
Response from Children’s Social Care:
No relevant information held
Response from Adults Social Care:
Anyone entering a care home will have a care plan, and this will take into account dietary needs and preferences. This plan is overseen by the care home and the GP and a Social worker, where appropriate, in an annual review."

they do/do not consume or contracts with catering companies.

RESPONSE: The Council is preparing a sustainable food options paper to take to Climate Governance Board. The proposal is to create a policy or set of guidelines that colleagues can use when procuring food for events. The policy will support colleagues to provide catering that is more sustainable by offering more vegan options, ensuring local food is prioritised, and meeting other important Food for Life standards such as animal welfare. These actions will appear in our sustainable food options paper. The Climate Governance Board will have the decision of which options to pursue. The Council is committed to reducing our carbon footprint as a Council, and part of that will include promoting plant-based diets and meat reduction. Our sustainable food options paper will explore the different ways to make our food provision more sustainable, and the Climate Governance board will decide which targets we set to reduce our meat consumption and carbon footprint. The options paper will also encourage local food procurement and meet other important standards like animal welfare.
Schools meals provision - offer all schools a meat free day every week.
Leisure centres - No, although we will caterer for vegans and work hard to increase our vegan range, whilst promoting the benefits of a vegan diet, it is a personal choice and we have a responsibility to caterer for all people within our community. If we remove meat options, we risk isolating people sending them elsewhere where food may not be put together as responsibility sourced as us. We only use meat/dairy with traceability. I.e. freedom food, red tractor and RSPCA assurance."

b. In line with Section 18.2 of the Southwark Outdoor Events policy with regards to event
catering, all event organisers are required to provide healthy food and drink options at their
event in line with the council’s Healthy Weight strategy.
Alongside the Outdoor Events Policy in April 2023, the Council introduced the Events
Environmental Sustainability Guide to support our commitment to be carbon neutral borough
by 2030.
All events taking place in public outdoor spaces in the borough will need to be carbon neutral,
as a minimum by then. ‘Carbon neutral’ means that there is no net release of carbon dioxide
(CO2) into the atmosphere.
The guide includes a section which deals with Food and Drink provision at Outdoor events
and sets out what the Council now require organisers to implement in their plans, which
includes:
• Include plant-based options in your food provision (meat/dairy products often have the
highest carbon footprint of any food items due to the way they are produced)
• Stipulate that caterers must use products that are certified organic
• Ask caterers to use products that are from sustainable sources
Please find attached the Food and Drink Section of the guide.
c&3. The Climate Change Action Plan has a section to ‘support more sustainable diets’ and a
number of associated actions. This includes actions on public campaigns to promote more
climate-friendly diets, a focus on schools, tackling food waste and establishing networks to
share surplus food. The majority of these actions are to be taken forward via the council’s
Sustainable Food Strategy and the ‘Healthy people, healthy planet’ ambition.
When training the providers of our Holiday Food and Fun programme, we encourage them to
reduce meat and dairy consumption and encourage meat free days. We also train them on the
School Food Standards and they have to cater for all dietary restrictions including religious,
allergies and vegan/vegetarian lifestyle choices.

This is not a valid request for recorded information under the Freedom of Information Act.

How many vegan hot and cold meal options do you offer:

In your own local authority canteen every day (if you have one)? 0, 1, 2, 3 or more. Please also express this as a proportion of the overall number of options offered. 

Lewisham Council do not have a canteen.

Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings?  Yes/No

To gather this information would entail a search across all departments of the Council as the information would not be held centrally. To gather this information would exceed the time/cost limit. We therefore apply S12 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, ‘Exemption where cost of compliance exceeds appropriate limit’.

Section 12 states:
(1) Section 1(1) does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit.
(2) Subsection (1) does not exempt the public authority from its obligation to comply with paragraph (a) of section 1(1) unless the estimated cost of complying with that paragraph alone would exceed the appropriate limit.
(3) In subsections (1) and (2) “the appropriate limit” means such amount as may be prescribed, and different amounts may be prescribed in relation to different cases.
(4) The Secretary of State may by regulations provide that, in such circumstances as may be prescribed, where two or more requests for information are made to a public authority—
(a) by one person, or
(b) by different persons who appear to the public authority to be acting in concert or in pursuance of a campaign, the estimated cost of complying with any of the requests is to be taken to be the estimated total cost of complying with all of them.
(5) The Secretary of State may by regulations make provision for the purposes of this section as to the costs to be estimated and as to the manner in which they are to be estimated.

This acts as a refusal notice. This information is not held in a readily accessible format. It is estimated that the cost of locating, retrieving and collating the information would cost in excess of £450 (the set limit) and therefore exceeds the 'appropriate level' as stated in the Freedom of Information (Fees and Appropriate Limit) Regulations 2004 (http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2004/uksi_20...).

(Costs for staff time i.e. staff retrieving and collating information are set at £25 per hour and this task would require us to spend more than 18 hours of staff time on preparing the relevant information. You are able to make a payment so that this task could be undertaken. You may also modify your request to reduce the cost of this task. Please contact us if you wish to proceed with one of these options).

chain, to providing healthy food, and openness to providing more plant-based
options.
• Work with the Procurement team to develop time-bound and measurable
targets for healthier and sustainable food for future contracts, and to work with
current suppliers to increase nutritional value and sustainability of food

School caterers follow Food or Life standards and have meat free days, but the council do not set specific targets about meat reduction. The Good Food in Greenwich (local food partnership commissioned by the council) promote sustainability messaging including meat reduction but do not set targets. Early years settings and HAF (holiday activity) providers work to good food standards but again, the council do not set specific meat reduction targets as part of this work.

Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council,red,"The Council does not operate a canteen for staff use, nor does it supply any food hot or otherwise in the majority it's buildings. The majority of care homes are independent organisations so are responsible for their own food contracts/provision

However - we do have our own provision in terms of Albion Mill which is registered as a care home. We also have a Respite Care centre - St Aidens and Hopwood Court

Vegan food is prepared for those who require a vegan diet in all of our building based services including Albion Mill (intermediate Care Centre), St Aidans (Respite) and Hopwood Court (Day Centre)

In both St Aidans and Hopwood Court we have onsite cooks who cater for peoples dietary requirement whilst in Albion Mill we use a company called Apetito who deliver frozen meals that we reheat and serve. Apetito provide a wide variety of different meal options including Vegan.

In regards of St Aiden's, Hopwood Court and Albion Mill, the action to reduce meat and dairy consumption in order to meet environmental goals would be taken from an organisational point of view and not a service led point of view.

From our service point of view we do try to vary our menus and include a wide variety of choice including vegetarian and fish and poultry options (even for those who are not vegetarian) so we are always conscious of the environmental impacts and use of meat.

In terms of dairy consumption again we are conscious of the impact and do attempt to use alternative products wherever possible.

Mid and East Antrim Borough Council,red,"Dear FOI team,

Thank you for your response to our Freedom of Information request. While Northern Ireland has separate equality legislation to the Equality Act 2010, veganism is nevertheless a protected philosophical belief in Northern Ireland.

The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland explicitly included veganism in the interpretation of legislation:

""Philosophical belief’ covers other beliefs about weighty and substantial aspects of human life and behaviour. They must attain certain levels of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance; and be worthy of respect in a democratic society, be not incompatible with human dignity and be not in conflict with the fundamental rights of others. Examples might include humanism, pacifism, veganism, spiritualism.""

Northern Ireland is also subject to the Human Rights Act 1998 and is under a duty not to contravene the rights made available in the Human Rights Act 1998. Veganism is protected under Article 9 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

With reference to the above, does your decision-making regarding the provision of food take into account the fact that veganism is a protected characteristic?

Yours sincerely,

1. Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings? ?

The Council does not have any catering procurement contracts. Catering for schools, care homes etc. is undertaken by Hampshire County Council. There are a number of public buildings that the Council owns and/or manages but, as these buildings/spaces are staffed and managed internally, there are no catering contracts for these.

• If no, do you have ambitions to take action in this area, eg through setting meat reduction targets? Yes/no, if yes please detail what ambitions you have set out.

 The public spaces/buildings that provide catering have plant-based options on their menus. For example, currently 50% of the kitchen menu in our country parks is plant-based. This is around 8-10 items depending on seasonable options. As part of the Country Parks Service Plan for 2023/24, we are removing all beef-based items from the menu and have a set target to maintain a minimum of 40% of the kitchen menu as plant-based at all times. We offer dairy alternatives for drinks, cakes and menu items such as sandwiches, pastries etc. Pre-packed options such as ice creams, canned drinks, crisps and confectionary all have plant-based alternatives available.

    •	In external events catering (if applicable)? Eg: 0, 1, 2, 3 or more.  Please also express this as a proportion of the overall number of options offered.
A council motion of 26th May 2022, Council resolves to: Ensure that there is a minimum of one plant-based food option available at all City Council run events which involve catering (ie minimum from at least one caterer), where reasonably possible.

The requirement from this Council motion is followed by events on City Council open spaces. However they do not hold further information, they do not record the number of hold and cold options.


The requirement from the council motion of 26th May 2022 is also followed by other events arranged by the City Events team. In 2022: there were 26 caterers between our events, all 26 offered both vegetarian and vegan options. 1 caterer was fully vegan throughout, 3 caterers were fully vegetarian with vegan options. Typically for every 2.5 non-vegan mains, there was 1 vegan.
With regards to civic events, at the Council’s Remembrance Service Civic event in November 2022, 50% of the catering was plant-based. 
At Environment and Community Scrutiny Committee on 19 January 2023, the Executive Councillor agreed:
 
‘Catering at Annual Full Council meeting in 2023 will consist of 75% plant-based options. This will increase to 100% plant-based in 2024, and 100% plant-based in 2025, providing that the majority of plant-based choices are consumed at events and that suppliers can fulfil this requirement and at the same cost as non-plant based foods.’ 
iii. Catering at all other civic events in 2023 (apart from the Annual Full Council meeting) will consist of 25% plant-based options with the remaining 75% made up of vegetarian and meat and dairy options. This will increase to 50% plant-based options in 2024, 75% in 2025, and 100% in 2026, providing that the majority of plant-based choices are consumed at events and that suppliers can fulfill this requirement and at the same cost as non-plant based foods. 

3. Is a requirement for providing vegan hot and cold meal options included within the catering procurement contracts you issue for other catering provision for which you are responsible including schools, leisure centres, care homes, libraries, and any other public buildings?  Yes/No    
Cafes in our community centres and leisure centres provide plant-based options.

The council motion of 26th May 2022, also included a requirement that Council resolved to: Secure through a contract specification, when re-tendering for suppliers plant-based options will be available at kiosks on City Council run open spaces and cafes (where reasonably possible). This requirement applies to cafes at community centres and leisure centres.

This requirement for plant-based options to be available has already been included in new contracts for two community centres. 

Where a contract is currently not yet up for re-tender, suppliers are encouraged to provide plant-based meals. For example, our Holiday lunch programme encourages lunch hosts to provide plant-based recipes and meals.
Cambridge City Council is not responsible for schools, libraries or social care.

 4. Has your organisation taken any action to reduce meat and dairy consumption in order to meet environmental goals?     
•If yes, please detail what actions have been taken, e.g. 100% or 50% plant-based food options offered.

At the Council’s Environment and Community Scrutiny Committee on 19 January 2023, the Executive Councillor agreed: 

i. All future civic events will promote plant-based food by always providing some plant-based food options and plant-based milks as standard (where reasonably possible). 
ii. ‘Catering at Annual Full Council meeting in 2023 will consist of 75% plant-based options. This will increase to 100% plant-based in 2024, and 100% plant-based in 2025, providing that the majority of plant-based choices are consumed at events and that suppliers can fulfil this requirement and at the same cost as non-plant based foods.’ 
iii. Catering at all other civic events in 2023 (apart from the Annual Full Council meeting) will consist of 25% plant-based options with the remaining 75% made up of vegetarian and meat and dairy options. This will increase to 50% plant-based options in 2024, 75% in 2025, and 100% in 2026, providing that the majority of plant-based choices are consumed at events and that suppliers can fulfill this requirement and at the same cost as non-plant based foods. 
iv. The Council will no longer procure and serve beef and lamb at civic events due to their impact on greenhouse gas emissions and will reduce the amount of pork procured for civic events.

4. With there being no staff canteen, there are limited ways to encourage the vegan agenda at the Council other than through what we serve in public buildings and at events.

Where vendors are used, they are asked to provide options for all dietary needs and requirements.

Other large scale events such as Bikefest, Food Festival and Christmas Light Switch On are organised by the local town centre BID, Rugby First. I am aware that external caterers that are invited include vendors who cater for all dietary requirements and protected characteristics such as veganism."
